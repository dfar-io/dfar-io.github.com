Definitely worth the read. Some of the notes:</p><ul><li>We judge value on things based on the context of other things around it – making it difficult to judge the value of something absolutely.</li><li>Question your repeated behaviors – and make sure they aren’t just happening out of habit (ex. getting a regular coffee, do you need to get it)?</li><li>Things being free gives the image of not having a loss associated to it, although there is always a cost of owning things.</li><li>Between market (cash) and social (gift) norms, try to keep social norms as long as possible. Gifts make for a good social lubricant.</li><li>Avoiding temptation is easier than trying to overcome it.</li><li>Running around and trying to keep everything open as an option ends up making for a shallow experience. Better to pick a few focuses and stick with them (I’ve read this in a few places).</li><li>Expectations affect experience (if you are told something will be good/bad before experiencing, you will be biased).</li></ul></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
