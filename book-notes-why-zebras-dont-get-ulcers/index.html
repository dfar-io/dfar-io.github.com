The big takeaways:</p><ul><li>Stress-related sickness comes from the basic fact that we have our stress-response <em>(response to stressor to return to homeostatis)</em> turned on continually, as opposed to in the appropriate fight-or-flight situations.</li><li>Provides an aversion to Hans Seyle’s 3 part of stress, General Adaptation Principle:<ul><li>Alarm – stressor, initial reaction, flight or flight</li><li>Resistance – stress-response, attempted recovery to homeostatis</li><li>Exhaustion – <strong>the point where the stress-response becomes more harmful than the stressor</strong> (as opposed to the stressor causing exhaustion)</li></ul></li><li><strong>The opposite of love is not hate – it’s indifference.</strong></li><li>Having less social relationships is correlated to shorter lifespan and worse health.</li><li>Type-A personalities generally associated with higher levels of stress-related disease.</li><li>Addiction:<ul><li>Turning point of addiction – when issue comes not from good feeling of drug, but bad feeling from it’s absence.</li><li>“No such thing as an ex-addict, just an addict not in the context that triggers use”</li></ul></li><li>Subset of healthy population in old age traits:<ul><li>No smoking</li><li>Minimal alcohol use</li><li>Lots of exercise</li><li>Normal body weight</li><li>No depression</li><li>Stable and happy marriage</li><li>Mature, resilient coping style (extroversion, social connectedness, low neuroticism)</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=building-blocks-of-physiological-stressors>Building Blocks of Physiological Stressors</h2><ul><li>Having outlets for frustration</li><li>Social support</li><li>Predictability</li><li>Control (belief of control, not necessarily actual control)</li><li>A perception of things worsening</li></ul><h2 id=effect-of-poverty-on-stress>Effect of Poverty on Stress</h2><p>Poverty in general provides an environment of high stress and plenty of issues.
