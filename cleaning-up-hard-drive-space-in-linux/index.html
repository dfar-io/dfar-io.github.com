<h1>Cleaning up Hard Drive Space in Linux</h1><time>September 30, 2019</time></header><p>If you run into a situation where a Linux machine is running out of space, here’s a way to check what is taking up so much space and clean the server up.</p>
<p>Install <code>ncdu</code>:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install ncdu</code></p>
<p>Afterwards, start <code>ncdu</code> and you’ll be presented with an interface that’ll walk you through the directories taking the most space:</p>

<h2 id=troubleshooting-8211-my-drive-is-100-full>Troubleshooting – My Drive is 100% Full</h2>
<p>If you’re having trouble installing the above, you likely have a full drive that cannot do anything else. Here are a few steps that may help:</p>
<p>First, see if there are any individual files you can delete to clear some space (such as in the user directory). If this isn’t an option, go into <code>/var/tmp</code> and delete the files in there () this is not always a safe choice).</p>
<p>After that, run the following:</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt install byobu
sudo purge-old-kernels
sudo apt autoremove
sudo update-grub
</code></pre><p>With this you should be able to install the above and check into what is taking up so much space.</p>
