I'm a Software/DevOps Engineer based out of Michigan. 

* Technology I'm currently working/interested in includes .NET, Azure, Terraform,
Arch Linux, and Java.
* When I'm not working, I'm spending with my wife and two pups,
[lifting weights](/wl-log), drinking [dry hard cider](/cider)
and eating sushi.
