I'm a Software/DevOps Engineer based out of Michigan. 

* Technology I'm currently working/interested in includes .NET (including [nopCommerce](https://www.nopcommerce.com/en)), Azure, GCP, Terraform, Arch Linux, and PHP.
* When I'm not working, I'm spending time with my wife and two pups,
lifting weights, playing games, and eating sushi.

To get a hold of me, you can email me at <d@dfar.io>.
