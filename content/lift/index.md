# Review

Progress went like the following:
* Squat 70 -> 130 (117)
* Press 40 -> 55 (50)
* DL 100 -> 150 (135)
* PC 70 -> 90 (81)

I'm liking this idea of having phases that go until something comes up, like a vacation or such. I have another coming up in August, so this will give me about 5 weeks, or 14-15 workouts to progress, so I have a few goals:

* Squat 117 -> 140
* Front Squat 70 -> 90
* Press 50 -> 62
* DL 135 -> 160
* PC 81 -> 100

I'm going to do a few things different:
* Officially giving up barbell bench, just going to stick with DB bench since I like how it feels much more. I will need to figure out a solution for loading this.... maybe get a set of Olympic dumbbells and adjust them, and then use my change plates? (would have to get a set of change plates)
* Going to start front squatting 80% of my squat on Mondays just to change things up a bit (5x3).
* Sticking with straight bar curls to use that LP
* Going to start working out again for Meathead Kart, using some kind of volume setup.... more to come.

Meaning the program looks like (6 days, alternating, Friday off):

## Day 1
* Squat/Front Squat
* Press/DB Bench
* DL/PC

## Day 2
