To rip DVDs, first do the following:

  * Download <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="HandBrake (opens in a new tab)" href="https://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank">HandBrake</a>
  * Download <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="libdvdcss2 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://download.videolan.org/libdvdcss/1.2.11/win64/" target="_blank">libdvdcss2</a> and place the DLL into the Handbrake directory

After the above is done, open Handbrake and open the DVD as a source. It&#8217;ll take a long time to load the data in place, and then you&#8217;ll have the ability to select different chapters to rip.

Select the desired title to rip and click &#8216;Encode&#8217;. After the process completes, you&#8217;ll be able to view the video.
