Over the last few days, I decided to re-read [Dave Ramsey&#8217;s The Total Money Makeover][1] just to skim it and go through anything I might have missed. I read this book about 8 years ago when finances were more tight, and a lot of the information is pretty helpful.

The takeaway I got after reading a second time was that this book works well for someone that doesn&#8217;t have much of an idea on how to handle finances. For someone without any opinion on how to manage their money, this provides a pretty simple workflow to get yourself on the right track.

However, if you&#8217;re someone who has more experience, you&#8217;ll probably find this book doesn&#8217;t teach anything new. Re-reading it the second time, nothing notable came out to me as something I was missing in my financial management. Another issue is that there are a few somewhat controversial ideas that don&#8217;t apply if you have decent discipline (avoiding credit use, paying down a house 100%, or only using 15 year mortgages come to mind) that can end up hurting you in the long run.

A couple major points:

  * The snowball method of paying down debt (paying down lowest balance first) I do think has some merit &#8211; although you lose out on some interest paid, I think in the long run you end up more motivated to keep on track.
  * Staying debt-free is promoted as the best way to build wealth, which I think makes sense &#8211; avoiding regular payments and using the income provided to build wealth.
  * Valuable to think long term as possible, especially with overall cost of items (think &#8220;how much&#8221;, not &#8220;how much a month?&#8221;)
  * Important types of insurance to have:
      * Auto & Home &#8211; high deductibles for lower premiums
      * Life &#8211; 20 year term equal to about 10x income, don&#8217;t place savings in life insurance here
      * Disability &#8211; purchase through work if possible
      * Health &#8211; high deductibles for lower premiums, alongside use of HSA
      * Long-Term Care Insurance &#8211; if >60 years old
  * Large tax return? You need to adjust your withholding to allow use of that money throughout the year.
