Pretty good and interesting read overall &#8211; mostly touches on some of the repeatable unusual things in human behavior. Definitely worth the read. Some of the notes:

  * We judge value on things based on the context of other things around it &#8211; making it difficult to judge the value of something absolutely.
  * Question your repeated behaviors &#8211; and make sure they aren&#8217;t just happening out of habit (ex. getting a regular coffee, do you need to get it)?
  * Things being free gives the image of not having a loss associated to it, although there is always a cost of owning things.
  * Between market (cash) and social (gift) norms, try to keep social norms as long as possible. Gifts make for a good social lubricant.
  * Avoiding temptation is easier than trying to overcome it.
  * Running around and trying to keep everything open as an option ends up making for a shallow experience. Better to pick a few focuses and stick with them (I&#8217;ve read this in a few places).
  * Expectations affect experience (if you are told something will be good/bad before experiencing, you will be biased).
