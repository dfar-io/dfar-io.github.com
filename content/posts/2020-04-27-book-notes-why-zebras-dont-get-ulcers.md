Pretty interesting read that goes into the details on how stress affects us as we&#8217;re generally in situations that generate chronic stress (as opposed to wildlife, that deals with acute stress). The big takeaways:

  * Stress-related sickness comes from the basic fact that we have our stress-response _(response to stressor to return to homeostatis)_ turned on continually, as opposed to in the appropriate fight-or-flight situations.
  * Provides an aversion to Hans Seyle&#8217;s 3 part of stress, General Adaptation Principle:
      * Alarm &#8211; stressor, initial reaction, flight or flight
      * Resistance &#8211; stress-response, attempted recovery to homeostatis
      * Exhaustion &#8211; **the point where the stress-response becomes more harmful than the stressor** (as opposed to the stressor causing exhaustion)
  * **The opposite of love is not hate &#8211; it&#8217;s indifference.**
  * Having less social relationships is correlated to shorter lifespan and worse health.
  * Type-A personalities generally associated with higher levels of stress-related disease.
  * Addiction:
      * Turning point of addiction &#8211; when issue comes not from good feeling of drug, but bad feeling from it&#8217;s absence.
      * &#8220;No such thing as an ex-addict, just an addict not in the context that triggers use&#8221;
  * Subset of healthy population in old age traits:
      * No smoking
      * Minimal alcohol use
      * Lots of exercise
      * Normal body weight
      * No depression
      * Stable and happy marriage
      * Mature, resilient coping style (extroversion, social connectedness, low neuroticism)

## Building Blocks of Physiological Stressors

  * Having outlets for frustration
  * Social support
  * Predictability
  * Control (belief of control, not necessarily actual control)
  * A perception of things worsening

## Effect of Poverty on Stress

Poverty in general provides an environment of high stress and plenty of issues. Includes:

  * Lack of capability to think ahead (constantly putting out fires).
  * Lack of outlets (unable to get away due to lack of funds/resources)
  * Experiencing poverty early in life makes one sensitive to stressors (even if they rise above poverty)
