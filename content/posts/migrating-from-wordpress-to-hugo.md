I decided to clean up my website and move to a static site for a few reasons:

First, I created the Hugo site by following the
[Quick Start Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) at Hugo,
picking a theme, then committing the changes to my Github (also adding a
_.gitignore_ file that wasn't included).
