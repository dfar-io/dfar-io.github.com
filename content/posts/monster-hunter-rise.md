## Greatsword

* Use draw attacks (stages 1 and 2, charge to level 2 minimum)
* Look for Strongarm stance opportunities for TCS
* Immediate draw -> charge -> tackle -> TCS (fastest from sheathe to TCS)

## Long Sword

* Use Sakura Slash to get to red charge
* Leverage counters
  * ZR+A -> ZR (reactive, long window, cancel sheathe with ZR+B)
  * ZR+B -> ZR (predictive, can ZL+X out of it)

## Sword and Shield

* Use Metsu when possible (ZL+A -> A)
* Use backstep to avoid attacks when Metsu not available

## Dual Blades

* Elemental, dash juice
* Stay above 1/3 stamina, demon gauge

## Lance

* Insta-block when not in-thrust, counter thrust otherwise
* Guard Dash/Spiral Thrust quickest blocking options out of thrust

## Gunlance

* Blast Dash useful for closing gap
* Erupting Cannon
  * followup for Ground Splitting/Guard Edge
  * Can combo into L+X
* Full burst: X+A (slam) -> A (burst) -> X (wide sweep, very laggy) -> ZR+A (quick reload) -> repeat
* L+X -> X+A -> A -> X -> ZR+A -> (moving full burst)
* ZR+X -> ZR+A -> FullBurst(standing full burst)

## Hammer

* Switch and stay in strength mode
* ZR -> Charge 2 for small openings, immediate Water Strike
* ZR -> Charge 3 when possible, standing still > moving

## Hunting Horn

* Use echo mode
* Keep Silkbind Shockwave up as much as possible, use to tank attacks/roars
* ^A -> ZR
* ^A -> ^XA -> ZR
* ^X -> ZR (to play )

## Switch Axe

* Elemental
* Open with:
  * ZR (sword) -> ZR (axe) for quick openings
  * L+X -> ZR -> A -> ZR for longer openings
* ZR (sword) -> A (double slash) -> ZR (axe), best overall DPS

## Charge Blade

* Elemental
* X -> A (hold) (full phials with load shells)
* X -> X -> X -> X+A -> repeat (allows for easy guard points)

## Insect Glaive

* X -> A -> A (best grounded combo)
* ZL+A -> ZR+A -> ZR+A -> ZL+A (only need 2 kinsect glide hits if using silkbind vault)

## Light Bowgun
