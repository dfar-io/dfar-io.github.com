The [State of CSS 2020](https://2020.stateofcss.com/en-US/) was recently released,
and my quick takeaways are:

* Both [Flexbox](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and
[CSS Grid](https://codepip.com/games/grid-garden/) have a lot of usage and
should be adopted.
* In terms of tech, SASS is extremely well liked and prominent.
* I should be using both [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) and Prettier 
(even in non-JS projects).
* Bootstrap has a neutral reaction, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a compelling alternative.
* BEM seems to be the most relevant naming convention.
