_I was not feeling motivated for this workout either, but after getting started, I was able to finish strong. I was thinking about reprioritizing things, but ultimately, everything works out well as is. I think the main thing to do is to put some more focus on the volume work, and not worry so much about the heavy single. I think new job is draining me a bit, so I should go through my schedule and try to simplify things a bit more._
