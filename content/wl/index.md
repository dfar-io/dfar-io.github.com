## Summary

* 135 clean, feeling great overall
* Found a decent challenge in 170 squat
* Missed 83 press

Changes being made:
 * Dropping heavy presses and treating "press" day as a lighter day
 * Dropping end of cycle deload
 * Moving to 6x a week (taking off Fridays)
 * Add a kg to each of the minimum lifts (once it's too much, I'll do doubles)
 * Add a single drop set for each core lift (cleans, squats)
 * Adding fat grips to curls
 * Adding weight to hypers

Finally, in terms of scheduling, I'm moving to 6x a week. I've been slightly
inconsistent on training as as whole, but overall I made 18/21 days, which I'm
very content with.

## 2021.01.22
* FG Press/BPA 3 x 12/15 x 21.75kg

_Kind of tough to lift at hoke with the dogs sometimes. I might have to just accept that weekends will have less lifting than I'd like._

## 2021.01.21
* FG Press/BPA 3 x 12/15 x 21.5kg

## 2021.01.20
* Press 80, 83 x 0
* FG Press/BPA 3 x 12/15 x 21.25kg
* Pullups 6, 6

_little disappointed on the press, since I'll be only pressing daily at this
point and removing heavy presses._

## 2021.01.19
* FG Press/BPA 3 x 12/15 x 21

## 2021.01.18

* regular and hammers_
* Holds 1min10sec 

## 2021.01.17

by next year this time. Weather was decent so gonna do carries when I can.
Finished up in around 45 min._

## 2020.01.14
* Press/BPA 3 x 12/15 x 20kg

_Dan convinced me to try daily pressing (even on off days) with band
pull-aparts. I ordered some Fat Gripz and micro plates and will increment
0.25kg every day, making for a 1.75kg bump every week, or doing 40 in around 3
months. Going to try to stick with doing 12 reps as long as possible._

## 2020.01.13
* Clean 130, 133

_I felt a little queasy so I stopped after clean. I missed yesterday due to
work, going to move to 5 days a week to give myself some space. If all goes
well, going for 135 next time._
