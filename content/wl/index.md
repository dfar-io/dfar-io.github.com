## 2021.03.16
* Squat 140

_Going to try something different - using Dan's rationale and bumping up +0.25kg every workout, and at the end of the month I'll change things up a bit._

## 2021.03.08
* Pushups 20, 20

## 2021.03.05

_do sets of 5 next time_

## 2021.03.02
* FBench/B - 3 x 12 x 30lb _increase weigbt_

## 2021.03.01

_work is really picking up so I need to just focus on small daily work._

## 2021.02.24 - Meathead Kart
* FP/B 30 x 3/10 x 40k

_I was having a hard time remember which to alternate, so decided to just do one movement through the whole thing, and balance the BPAs. Shoulder are feeling
much better than when I did it before._

## 2021.02.17 - Meathead Kart
* FP - 18 x 3 x 40
* Pullups 18 x 2

_Since we're playing 5:30 to 8, I can expect about 18 sets of whatever I'm doing. I'm going to increase the reps before I increase the weight for both lifts. It started to get challenging near the end._

## 2021.02.16
* Squat 160
* FBench/B 3 x 12 x 5,10,15lb _im gonna start with 30lb and work up_
* Hyper 3 x 12
* JR 4 x 30j/10du

_Sometimes it seems like doing 4 exercises in a day is a lot, but when I get into the groove, it all works out great. I really want to keep a streak going, even if the work is minimal, instead of taking time off. I can always change the paradigm of what I'm doing if I feel I'm burning out._

## 2021.02.15
* Clean 120
* FP/B 3 x 12/15 x 20k

_I took 10 days off, so going to just ease back into everything. I cut down on overall training a bit and am picking a few more things to just focus on. Work has been busier than I expected, so I've been putting lifting on the backburner_

## 2021.02.10
Meathead MK

* OHP 8 x 3 x 41kg _easy_
* Pullups 8 x 2 _switched to pullup grip, I think these work my back better._

* Pullups 5,5,5
* Planks 3 x 1min

_I was not feeling motivated for this workout either, but after getting started, I was able to finish strong. I was thinking about reprioritizing things, but ultimately, everything works out well as is. I think the main thing to do is to put some more focus on the volume work, and not worry so much about the heavy single. I think new job is draining me a bit, so I should go through my schedule and try to simplify things a bit more._
