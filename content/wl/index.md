## 2021.01.29
* FG OHP 22 x 3 x 41kg

_tried something a little different, I think I'm gonna do this for gaming days and alternate with pullups._

## 2021.01.28
* FG OHP/BPA 3 x 12/15 x 23kg

* Pullups 5,5,5
* Planks 3 x 1min
* JR 4 x 60j

_I was not feeling motivated for this workout either, but after getting started, I was able to finish strong. I was thinking about reprioritizing things, but ultimately, everything works out well as is. I think the main thing to do is to put some more focus on the volume work, and not worry so much about the heavy single. I think new job is draining me a bit, so I should go through my schedule and try to simplify things a bit more._
