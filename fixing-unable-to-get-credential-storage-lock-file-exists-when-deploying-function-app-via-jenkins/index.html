<h1>Fixing “unable to get credential storage lock: File exists” when Deploying Function App via Jenkins</h1><time>July 24, 2019</time></header><p>When working with deploying Azure Function Apps with Jenkins, I ran into an issue when trying to rebuild a Function App from scratch with the same name. I was unable to deploy the codebase via Pipeline due to the following error:</p>
<p>I was able to fix by doing the following:</p>
<p>SSH into the server.</p>

<p>Delete the <code>.git-credentials.lock</code> file.</p>
<p>After doing this, try running the job again and ensure the issue has been solved.</p>
