If you’re serving an API using a Function app, you’ll want to put this in place to keep performance ideal.</p><p>Something to note with this solution – it works well for low-traffic APIs where the goal is to serve an API using the consumption app for low costs. Assuming larger traffic use, you may be better off switching to a dedicated App Service plan, to prevent the cold start issue at all, because cold starts will still come when scaling out.</p><p>To follow this guide, I’ll assume you already have a Function app in place. Create a new function with the following:</p><p>That’s it! After this is deployed, the cold start issue of your API should be removed, as running the log function every 15 minutes will prevent the system from needing a cold start.</p><h2 id=further-reading>Further Reading</h2><p><a href=https://mikhail.io/2018/05/azure-functions-cold-starts-beyond-first-load/>https://mikhail.io/2018/05/azure-functions-cold-starts-beyond-first-load/</a></p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
