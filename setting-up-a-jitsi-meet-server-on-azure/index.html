One option is to use an open-source solution like <a href=https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/>Jitsi Meet</a>, which provides both a <a href=https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/>public cloud version you can use easily</a>, and a version you can host on your own.</p><p>Why host on your own? You should consider hosting on your own if:</p><ul><li>You’re concerned with security – hosting the software on your own ensures a third part is uninvolved.</li><li>You want more hands on capability to change the specs on the server for performance based on when you’re using video software.</li><li>You can control the location of the hardware, which depending on where everyone is located, may improve performance.</li></ul><h2 id=server-creation-and-jitsi-installation>Server Creation and Jitsi Installation</h2><p>First, create an Azure VM with the following:</p><ul><li>Running Ubuntu</li><li>Open inbound ports 80, 443, and 22.</li><li>SSH key access <em>(recommended)</em></li></ul><p>Once the VM is created, SSH into the server and install the Jitsi full suite:</p><p>when installing, you’ll be asked to configure <code>jitsi-videobridge2</code>, use the URL you plan to use for this Jitsi instance. Afterwards, generate a self-signed certificate <em>(we’ll create one with Let’s Encrypt later)</em>.</p><p>To verify installation worked successfully, visit the IP address in a browser, <strong>making sure you use HTTPS</strong>.</p><h2 id=set-up-ssl-with-let8217s-encrypt>Set up SSL with Let’s Encrypt</h2><p>To set up SSL, you’ll need to set up a domain name for the server in place – you can either:</p><ul><li>Configure the Public IP assigned by Azure to create a domain name.</li><li>Using the process above, but also creating an A or CNAME record for a purchase domain pointing to the server IP</li></ul><p>Once this is done, you can run the following to automatically create a cert:</p><h2 id=reference>Reference</h2><p><a href=https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/quick-install.md#advanced-configuration>https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/quick-install.md#advanced-configuration</a></p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
