Each year, I go through and reinstall any system I have as a means to make sure I have this process down, alongside doing an audit to see what I’m actually using, to make sure I keep things clean.<br>Here’s the process I use when setting up a Windows 10 workstation:</p><h2 id=installation>Installation</h2><p>First, I go to the Microsoft website and create a bootable thumb drive containing Windows 10.<br>I restart my computer and boot to the thumb drive I created earlier. Once Windows setup loads, I end up selecting the option to <strong>Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)</strong>.<br>For my PC, I have two drives running in it:</p><ul><li>An SSD that’s responsible for storing the Windows 10 OS.</li><li>An HDD that’s responsible for holding all My Documents data, as well as everything for Dropbox.</li></ul><p>I’ll select to install to OS on the SSD and kick off the installation process. After some time, the installation will finish and the computer will restart.</p><h2 id=display-configuration>Display Configuration</h2><p>Once I have the Windows desktop running, I like to set up my display before I do anything else. I currently run 3 4K monitors with a GeForce 1080 Ti, so I will set up scaling and make sure the monitors are configured as desired.<br>Once that’s done, I set up Windows to display everything as desired, including:</p><ul><li>Shifting the Taskbar over to the right side, and only showing one taskbar.</li><li>Turn off Cortana, Tasks, and People</li><li>Changing to use Dark Mode for default apps</li></ul><h2 id=essentials-mail>Essentials: Mail</h2><p>Once I have the display set up correctly, the next step for setting up a Windows 10 workstation is to set up some of the essential software on the system. I like to use the Windows 10 Mail app for both my mail and calendar. I’ll access that and add all relevant accounts, and then make the following configurations:</p><ul><li>Creating a linked inbox</li><li>Turn off email notifications</li><li>Set Swipe Right to Delete</li><li>Create a signature for all accounts</li><li>Set the calendar to start on Monday</li></ul><h2 id=software-installation>Software Installation</h2><p>Next up is downloading a host of software to use for the PC. I use <a href=https://chocolatey.org/>Chocolatey</a> for as much as I can, so after setting it up through Powershell (as administrator), I install the following applications using Chocolatey:</p><ul><li>googlechrome <em>(sign in to account, configure extensions)</em></li><li>divvy <em>(register application, start Divvy at login, hide from tray, set Ctrl-Shift-Z as</em> shortcut_)_</li><li>7zip</li><li>ccleaner <em>(set up to check automatically)</em></li><li>dropbox <em>(log in and download all files, point to HDD)</em></li><li>filezilla</li><li>git</li><li>nodejs</li><li>libreoffice-fresh</li><li>vscode</li><li>rescuetime (log in)</li><li>bitnami-xampp (<a href=https://dfar.io/setting-up-a-local-wordpress-development-environment/>LAMP server instructions</a>, including setting up a full local WordPress installation)</li><li>mysql.workbench</li><li>postman</li><li>qbittorrent</li><li>steam</li><li>sql-server-management-studio</li><li>teamviewer</li><li>visualstudio2017community</li><li>azure-cli</li></ul><p>You can do this with one command, like so:</p><p>In addition, there are a few applications I use that aren’t in the Chocolatey package manager:</p><ul><li><a href=https://meetfranz.com/>Franz</a> – web application allowing me to combine Hangouts, Messenger and Slack into one application.</li><li><a href=https://github.com/hql287/Manta>Manta</a> – open source application I use for invoicing (looking for a replacement for this, one that can store data in the cloud).</li></ul><p>After everything is installed, I make sure to go through each of the applications if they need configuring <em>(the notes are above for applications that need to be configured)</em>.</p><h2 id=visual-studio-code-setup>Visual Studio Code Setup</h2><p>Once all of my software is set up, I take a look at Visual Studio Code and set it up, since that’s where most of my development occurs.<br>I install the following plugins:</p><ul><li>TSLint</li><li>Angular Language Service</li><li>EditorConfig for VS Code</li><li>Path Intellisense</li><li>Prettier – Code formatter</li><li>Terraform</li><li>PowerShell</li></ul><p>Once this is done, I install <a href=https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode>Fira Code</a> as the font to be used.<br>In terms of configuration, I copy and paste the current settings I like to use:</p><h2 id=configuring-powershell>Configuring PowerShell</h2><p>Once Visual Studio Code is set up, the next step is to configure Windows Powershell correctly. There are a few things to do here, build a profile, and then set up Azure CLI.<br>I run the following commands in administrator PowerShell:</p><p>Once that’s done, I should have a profile file created. I add the following to it:</p><p>Once that’s done, I’ll restart PowerShell to confirm that when it starts up, it’ll move to the D:.</p><h2 id=final-touches>Final Touches</h2><p>Once I’m all set with most things, there are a few more things I like to do:</p><ul><li>Hide all desktop apps</li><li>Unpin everything from the Taskbar</li></ul><h2 id=all-set-and-ready-to-go>All Set And Ready To Go</h2><p>Once all of that is done, we’re all set with setting up a Windows 10 workstation. I’ll take a look at this again in 2019 to see what changes in a year. Perhaps I’ll switch over to using Linux?]]></p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
