<h1>Using Azure Storage to Backup Data</h1><time>February 11, 2020</time></header><p>If you’re looking for an easy and cheap way to back up infrequently used data, you can set up a storage account in Azure with the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location: closest to your location.</li>
<li>Performance: Standard.</li>
<li>Account Kind: BlobStorage</li>
<li>Replication: Locally-redundant storage</li>
<li>Access tier: Cool</li>
</ul>
<p>After the storage account is created, you can upload your compressed files (suggested to maximize efficiency) to containers inside the storage account.</p>
<p>Once the files are uploaded, you have the option to change to the <strong>Archive</strong> access tier, which is useful for files you don’t plan on accessing frequently. This data, if ever needed, will take much longer to access.</p>
<p>My suggestion on above – stick to the cool tier and when looking for ways to save money on costs, change different blobs to archive tier as you find you won’t need to access.</p>
<p>Check out more details on pricing and more details on different access tiers.</p>
